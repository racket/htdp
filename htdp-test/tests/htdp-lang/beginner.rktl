;; Basic checks for the beginner language. Error messages really
;; should be inspected manually, but there's some support for
;; automatic checking.

;; Limitations of this test suite:
;;  - It doesn't check reader-level parameterization, such as use of quotes
;;  - It doesn't check format of printed results
;;  - It doesn't check the absence of Racket forms

;; Don't try to run other tests from the test suite after loading this
;; one into a particular namespace.

;; See also htdp-image.rkt, which must be loaded into GRacket (but is in this
;; directory anyway)

;; Tests that apply to all languages go in beg-adv.rkt.
;; Tests that apply only to beginner through intermediate go in beg-intm.rkt,
;;  and so on.

;; Writing tests:
;;  
;;   (htdp-test <expected> <name> <expr>)
;;     checks a run-time result; <expected> is
;;     an expression evaluated at the top level,
;;     and <expr> is put into a module and evaluated;
;;     <name> is usually a symbol, and it is used only for
;;     naming the test in output
;;
;;   (htdp-err/rt-test <expr>)
;;   (htdp-err/rt-test <expr> <exn-predicate>)
;;   (htdp-err/rt-test <expr> <message-rx-string>)
;;     checks for a run-time error by putting <expr> into a
;;     module and evaluting; if <exn-predicate> is supplied, the
;;     predicate must produce #t for the resulting exception;
;;     if <message-rx-string> is supplied, the exception
;;     message string must match the regexp
;;
;;   (htdp-syntax-test #'<expr>)
;;   (htdp-syntax-test #'<expr> <message-rx-string>)
;;     check for a syntax error, putting <expr> into a module;
;;     if <message-rs-string> is supplied, the syntax error
;;     message must match the regexp
;;
;;   (htdp-top <expr>)
;;     imperatively adds an expression to be included into
;;     test modules
;;   (htdp-top-pop <n>)
;;     removes the last <n> added expressions
;;
