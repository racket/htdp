@defmodule[#:require-form beginner-require 2htdp/image]

The image teachpack provides a number of basic image construction
functions, along with combinators for building more complex images out of
existing images. Basic images include various polygons, ellipses and
circles, and text, as well as bitmaps.@margin-note*{In the context of this
documentation, a @defterm{bitmap} denotes a special form of
@racket[image?], namely a collection of pixels associated with an image. It
does not refer to the @racket[bitmap%] class. Typically such image-bitmaps
come about via the @onscreen{Insert Image...} menu item in DrRacket}
Existing images can be rotated, scaled, flipped, and overlaid on top of each other.

In some situations images are rendered into bitmaps (e.g. when being shown in
the DrRacket Interactions window) In order to avoid bad performance
penalties, the rendering process limits the area of the images to
about 25,000,000 pixels (which requires about 100 MB of storage).

Adds a curve to @racket[scene], starting at the point
(@racket[x1],@racket[y1]), and ending at the point
(@racket[x2],@racket[y2]).

The @racket[angle1] and @racket[angle2] arguments specify the 
angle that the curve has as it leaves the initial point and
as it reaches the final point, respectively. 

The @racket[pull1] and @racket[pull2] arguments control how
long the curve tries to stay with that angle. Larger numbers
mean that the curve stays with the angle longer.

Unlike @racket[add-curve], this function crops the curve, only showing
the parts that fit onto @racket[scene].

@section{Bitmaps}

DrRacket's @seclink["images" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/drracket/drracket.scrbl")]{Insert Image ...} 
menu item allows you to insert images into your program text, and those images are treated 
as images for this library. 

Unlike all of the other images in this library, those images (and the other images created
by functions in this section of the documentation)
are represented as bitmaps, i.e., an array of colors (that can be quite large in some cases).
This means that scaling and rotating them loses fidelity in the image and is significantly
more expensive than with the other shapes.

See also the @racketmodname[2htdp/planetcute] library.

@defform/subs[(bitmap bitmap-spec)
              ([bitmap-spec rel-string
                            id])]{

  Loads the bitmap specified by @racket[bitmap-spec]. If
  @racket[bitmap-spec] is a string, it is treated as a relative path.
  If it is an identifier, it is treated like a require spec and used to
  refer to a file in a collection.

  @image-examples[(bitmap icons/stop-16x16.png)
                  (bitmap icons/b-run.png)]
}

@defproc[(bitmap/url [url string?]) image?]{
  Goes out on the web and downloads the image at @racket[url].

  Downloading the image happens each time this function is called, so
  you may find it simpler to download the image once with a browser 
  and then paste it into your program or download it and use @racket[bitmap].
}

@defproc[(bitmap/file [ps path-string?]) image?]{
  Loads the image from @racket[ps].

  If @racket[ps] is a relative path, the file is relative to
  the current directory. (When running in DrRacket, the current
  directory is set to the place where the definitions window is
  saved, but in general this can be an arbitrary directory.)
}


@defproc[(image->color-list [image image?]) (listof color?)]{
  Returns a list of colors that correspond to the colors in the
  image, reading from left to right, top to bottom.
  
  The list of colors is obtained by drawing the image on a white
  background and then reading off the colors of the pixels that were drawn.

                    [image image?]) image?])]{
  Freezing an image internally builds a bitmap, crops the image, draws the cropped image
  into the bitmap and then
  uses the bitmap to draw that image afterwards. Typically this is used as a performance
  hint. When an image both contains many sub-images and is going to be drawn many times
  (but not scaled or rotated),
  using freeze on the image can substantially improve performance without changing how
  the image draws (assuming it draws only inside its bounding box; see also @secref["nitty-gritty"]).
  
  If @racket[freeze] is passed only the image argument, then it crops the image to its bounding
  box. If it is given three arguments, the two numbers are used as the width and height and
  the five argument version fully specifies where to crop the image.

  }

@defproc[(image-baseline [i image?]) (and/c integer? (not/c negative?) exact?)]{
  Returns the distance from the top of the image to its baseline. 
  The baseline of an image is the place where the bottoms any letters line up, 
  but without counting the descenders, e.g. the tail on ``y'' or ``g'' or ``j''.
  
  Unless the image was constructed with @racket[text], @racket[text/font] 
  or, in some cases, @racket[crop], this will be the same as its height.
  
  @image-examples[(image-baseline (text "Hello" 24 "black"))

                  (image-height (rectangle 100 100 "solid" "black"))]

  A @racket[crop]ped image's baseline is the same as the image's baseline, if the
  cropping stays within the original image's bounding box. But if the cropping actually
  enlarges the image, then the baseline can end up being smaller.

@section{Image Predicates}

This section lists predicates for the basic structures provided by the image library.

@defproc[(image? [x any/c]) boolean?]{
 Determines if @racket[x] is an image. Images are returned by functions
 like @racket[ellipse] and @racket[rectangle] and
 accepted by functions like @racket[overlay] and @racket[beside].

 Additionally, images inserted into a DrRacket window are treated as
 bitmap images, as are instances of @racket[image-snip%] and @racket[bitmap%].
 }

@defproc[(mode? [x any/c]) boolean?]{
 Determines if @racket[x] is a mode suitable for
 constructing images. 
 
 It can be one of
 @racket['solid], @racket["solid"], @racket['outline],
 or @racket["outline"], indicating if the shape is
 filled in or not.
 
 It can also be an integer between @racket[0] and @racket[255] (inclusive)
 indicating the transparency of the image. The integer @racket[255] is
 fully opaque, and is the same as @racket["solid"] (or @racket['solid]).
 The integer @racket[0] means fully transparent.
}

@defproc[(image-color? [x any/c]) boolean?]{

  Determines if @racket[x] represents a color. Strings, symbols,
  and @racket[color] structs are allowed as colors.

  For example,
  @racket["magenta"], @racket["black"], @racket['orange], and @racket['purple]
  are allowed. Colors are not case-sensitive, so 
  @racket["Magenta"], @racket["Black"], @racket['Orange], and @racket['Purple]
  are also allowed, and are the same colors as in the previous sentence.
  If a string or symbol color name is not recognized, black is used in its place.
  
  The complete list of colors is the same as the colors allowed in
  @racket[color-database<%>], plus the color @racket["transparent"], a transparent
  color.

@defstruct[color ([red (and/c natural-number/c (<=/c 255))]

                  [alpha (and/c natural-number/c (<=/c 255))])]{
  The @racket[color] struct defines a color with @racket[red], 
      @racket[green], @racket[blue], and @racket[alpha] components
      that range from @racket[0] to @racket[255]. 
      
    The @racket[red], @racket[green], and @racket[blue] fields
      combine to make a color, with the higher values meaning more of the given color. 
      For example, @racket[(make-color 255 0 0)] makes a
      bright red color and @racket[(make-color 255 0 255)] makes a bright purple.
    
      The @racket[alpha] field controls the transparency of the color. A value of @racket[255] means
      that the color is opaque and @racket[0] means the color is fully transparent.
      
  The constructor, @racket[make-color], also accepts only three arguments, in which case
  the three arguments are used for the @racket[red], @racket[green], and @racket[blue] fields, and the
  @racket[alpha] field defaults to @racket[255].

      These points are used with the @racket[polygon] function
      and control how the edges can be curved.
      
      The first two pull and angle arguments indicate
      how an edge coming into this point should be curved.
      The angle argument indicates the angle as the edge
      reaches (@racket[x],@racket[y]) and a larger pull argument
      means that the edge should hold the angle longer.
      The last two are the same, except they apply to
      the edge leaving the point.

@section{Equality Testing of Images}

Two images are @racket[equal?] if they draw exactly the same way at their current size
(not necessarily at all sizes) and, if there are pinholes, the pinholes are
in the same place.

This can lead to some counter-intuitive results. For example, 
two completely different shapes that are the same size and are
drawn with the transparent color are equal:
@image-examples[(equal? (circle 30 "solid" "transparent")
                        (square 60 "solid" "transparent"))]
See also @secref["nitty-gritty-alpha"].

@section[#:tag "pinholes"]{Pinholes}

A pinhole is an optional property of an image that identifies a point somewhere
in the image. The pinhole can then be used to facilitate overlaying images by
lining them up on the their pinholes. 

When an image has a pinhole, the pinhole
is drawn with crosshairs on the image.
The crosshairs are drawn with two one-pixel wide black lines (one horizontal and one vertical)
and two one-pixel wide white lines,
where the black lines is drawn .5 pixels to the left and above the pinhole, and the
white lines are drawn .5 pixels to the right and below the pinhole. 
Accordingly, when the pixel is on an integral coordinate, then black and white lines all 
take up a single pixel and in the center of their intersections is the actual pinholes.
See @secref["nitty-gritty"] for more details about pixels.

When images are @racket[overlay]'d, @racket[underlay]'d (or the variants of those functions),
placed @racket[beside], or @racket[above] each other, 
the pinhole of the resulting image is the pinhole of 
the first image argument passed to the combining
operation. When images are combined with @racket[place-image]
(or the variants of @racket[place-image]), 
then the scene argument's pinhole is preserved.

@section{Exporting Images to Disk}

In order to use an image as an input to another program (e.g., Photoshop or 
a web browser), it is necessary to represent it in a format that these programs
can understand. 

The @racket[save-image] function provides this functionality, 
writing an image to disk using the @tt{PNG} format. Since this
format represents an image using a set of pixel values, an image written to disk
generally contains less information than the image that was written, and cannot be scaled
or manipulated as cleanly (by any image program).

The @racket[save-svg-image] function writes an @tt{SVG} file format
representation of the file to the disk that, unlike @racket[save-image] produces
an image that can still be scaled arbitrarily look as good as scaling the
image directly via @racket[scale].

@defproc[(save-image [image image?]

 and height of the save image file. If absent, the width and height of the image is used.
