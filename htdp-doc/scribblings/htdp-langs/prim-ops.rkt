A @racket[check-expect] expression must be placed at the top-level of a
 student program. Also it may show up anywhere in the program, including
 ahead of the tested function definition. By placing @racket[check-expect]s
 there, a programmer conveys to a future reader the intention behind the
 program with working examples, thus making it often superfluous to read
 the function definition proper. 

It is an error for @racket[expr] or @racket[expected-expr] to produce an
inexact number or a function value. As for inexact numbers, it is
@italic{morally} wrong to compare them for plain equality. Instead one
tests whether they are both within a small interval; see
@racket[check-within]. As for functions (see Intermediate and up), it is
provably impossible to compare functions. 
}

  @defform*[#:id [check-random check-random-id]
            [(check-random expression expected-expression)]]{

   Checks that the first @racket[expression] evaluates to the same value as the
   @racket[expected-expression].

The form supplies the same random-number generator to both parts. If both
parts request @racket[random] numbers from the same interval in the same
order, they receive the same random numbers. 

Here is a simple example of where @racket[check-random] is useful: 
@;%
@(begin
#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
(define WIDTH 100)
(define HEIGHT (* 2 WIDTH))

(define-struct player (name x y))
;; A @italic{Player} is @racket[(make-player String Nat Nat)]

;; String -> Player 

(check-random (create-randomly-placed-player "David Van Horn")
	      (make-player "David Van Horn" (random WIDTH) (random HEIGHT)))

(define (create-randomly-placed-player name)
  (make-player name (random WIDTH) (random HEIGHT)))
))
@;%
Note how @racket[random] is called on the same numbers in the same order in
 both parts of @racket[check-random]. If the two parts call @racket[random]
  for different intervals, they are likely to fail: 
@;%
@(begin
#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
;; String -> @italic{Player}

(check-random (create-randomly-placed-player "David Van Horn")
	      (make-player "David Van Horn" (random WIDTH) (random HEIGHT)))

(define (create-randomly-placed-player name)
  (local ((define h (random HEIGHT))
          (define w (random WIDTH)))
    (make-player name w h)))
))
@;%

It is an error for @racket[expr] or @racket[expected-expr] to produce a function
value or an inexact number; see note on @racket[check-expect] for details.
}

  @defform*[#:id [check-satisfied check-satisfied-id]
            [(check-satisfied expression predicate)]]{

   Checks that the first @racket[expression] satisfies the named
   @racket[predicate] (function of one argument).  Recall that
   ``satisfies'' means ``the function produces @racket[#true] for the given
   value.''

Here are simple examples for @racket[check-satisfied]: 
@interaction[
#:eval 
(mk-eval
 (require test-engine/racket-tests))
(check-satisfied 1 odd?)
]
@interaction[
#:eval 
(mk-eval
 (require test-engine/racket-tests))
(check-satisfied 1 even?)
]

In general @racket[check-satisfied] empowers program designers to use
defined functions to formulate test suites: 
@;%
@(begin
#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
;; [cons Number [List-of Number]] -> Boolean 
;; a function for testing @racket[htdp-sort]

(check-expect (sorted? (list 1 2 3)) #true)
(check-expect (sorted? (list 2 1 3)) #false)

(define (sorted? l)
  (cond
    [(empty? (rest l)) #true]
    [else (and (<= (first l) (second l)) (sorted? (rest l)))]))

;; [List-of Number] -> [List-of Number]
;; create a sorted version of the given list of numbers 

(check-satisfied (htdp-sort (list 1 2 0 3)) sorted?)

(define (htdp-sort l)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) l]
    [else (insert (first l) (htdp-sort (rest l)))]))

;; Number [List-of Number] -> [List-of Number]
;; insert @racket[x] into @racket[l] at proper place 
;; @bold{assume} @racket[l] is arranged in ascending order 
;; the result is sorted in the same way 
(define (insert x l)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) (list x)]
    [else (if (<= x (first l)) (cons x l) (cons (first l) (insert x (rest l))))]))
))
@;%

And yes, the results of @racket[htdp-sort] satisfy the @racket[sorted?] predicate:
@interaction[
#:eval evil 
(check-satisfied (htdp-sort (list 1 2 0 3)) sorted?)
]
}

  @defform*[#:id [check-within check-within-id]
            [(check-within expression expected-expression delta)]]{

  Checks whether the value of the @racket[expression] expression is
  structurally equal to the value produced by the
  @racket[expected-expression] expression; every number in the first
  expression must be within @racket[delta] of the corresponding number in
  the second expression.

@;%
@(begin
#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
(define-struct roots (x sqrt))
;; RT is [List-of (make-roots Number Number)]

(define (roots-table xs)
  (map (lambda (a) (make-roots a (sqrt a))) xs))
))
@;%

Due to the presence of inexact numbers in nested data, @racket[check-within] is the
correct choice for testing, and the test succeeds if @racket[delta] is reasonably
large: 
@examples[
#:eval 
(mk-eval
 (require test-engine/racket-tests)
 (define-struct roots (x sqrt) #:transparent)
 (define (roots-table xs) (map (lambda (a) (make-roots a (sqrt a))) xs)))

(check-within (roots-table (list 1. 2. 3.))
              (list 
	        (make-roots 1. 1.)
	        (make-roots 2  1.414)
	        (make-roots 3  1.713))
              .1)
]
In contrast, when @racket[delta] is small, the test fails: 
@examples[
#:eval 
(mk-eval
 (require test-engine/racket-tests)
(define-struct roots (x sqrt) 
  #:transparent
  #:methods gen:custom-write
  [(define (write-proc x port mode)
     (display `(make-roots ,(roots-x x) ,(roots-sqrt x)) port))])
 (define (roots-table xs) (map (lambda (a) (make-roots a (sqrt a))) xs)))

(check-within (roots-table (list 2.))
              (list 
	        (make-roots 2  1.414))
              .00001)
]

  It is an error for @racket[expressions] or @racket[expected-expression]
  to produce a function value; see note on @racket[check-expect] for details.

  If @racket[delta] is not a number, @check-within-elem reports an error.} 

  @defform*[#:id [check-error check-error-id]
            [(check-error expression expected-error-message)
             (#,check-error-elem expression)]]{

   Checks that the @racket[expression] reports an error, where the error messages
   matches the value of @racket[expected-error-message], if it is present.

Here is a typical beginner example that calls for a use of @racket[check-error]: 
@;%
@(begin
#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
(define sample-table
  '(("matthias" 10)
    ("matthew"  20)
    ("robby"    -1)
    ("shriram"  18)))

;; [List-of [list String Number]] String -> Number 
;; determine the number associated with @racket[s] in @racket[table] 

(define (lookup table s)
  (cond
    [(empty? table) (error (string-append s " not found"))]
    [else (if (string=? (first (first table)) s)
              (second (first table))
              (lookup (rest table)))]))
))
@;%

Consider the following two examples in this context: 

@examples[
#:eval (mk-eval
 (require test-engine/racket-tests racket/list)
(define sample-table
  '(("matthias" 10)
    ("matthew"  20)

   Makes the definitions of the module specified by @racket[string]

   @racket[string] refers to a file relative to the current file.

   The @racket[string] is constrained in several ways to avoid
   problems with different path conventions on different platforms: a
   @litchar{/} is a directory separator, @litchar{.} always means the
   current directory, @litchar{..} always means the parent directory,
   path elements can use only @litchar{a} through @litchar{z}
   (uppercase or lowercase), @litchar{0} through @litchar{9},
   @litchar{-}, @litchar{_}, and @litchar{.}, and the string cannot be
   empty or contain a leading or trailing @litchar{/}.}


  @defform/none[(#,require-elem module-name)]{

   Accesses a file in an installed library. The library name is an
   identifier with the same constraints as for a relative-path string
   (though without the quotes), with the additional constraint that it
   must not contain a @litchar{.}.}

  @defform/none[(#,require-elem (lib string string ...))]{

  Accesses a file in an installed library, making its definitions
  available in the current module (i.e., the current file). The first
  @racket[string] names the library file, and the remaining
  @racket[string]s name the collection (and sub-collection, and so on)
  where the file is installed. Each string is constrained in the same
  way as for the @racket[(#,require-elem string)] form.}
