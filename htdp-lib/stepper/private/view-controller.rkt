#lang racket/unit

;; this module implements the UI side of the stepper; it 
;; opens a window, starts the stepper thread running, 
;; and handles the resulting calls to 'break'.

;; this module lies outside of the "testing boundary"
;; of through-tests; it is not tested automatically at all.

;; this version of the view-controller just collects the steps up front rather
;; than blocking until the user presses the "next" button.
